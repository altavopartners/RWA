```

**Step 2: Update Server Environment**

```bash
# File: server/.env.production
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=4000
JWT_SECRET=<generate-secure-value-min-32-chars>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<user>:<pass>@<host>:5432/hexport_prod

# Hedera (choose testnet or mainnet)
HEDERA_NETWORK=testnet
HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=<your-account-id>
HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=<your-private-key>

# Keep other configuration as needed
# (IPFS, Storacha, etc.)
```

**Step 3: Database Setup**

```bash
# Create production database
createdb hexport_prod

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Verify setup
psql hexport_prod -c "SELECT 1"
```

**Step 4: Generate Production Secrets**

```bash
# Generate secure JWT secret
node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"

# Output: use this value for JWT_SECRET
```
