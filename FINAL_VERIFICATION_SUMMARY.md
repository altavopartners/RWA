## 📋 Critical Items Before Deployment

### ⚠️ MUST DO Before Pressing Deploy:

1. **Update Production Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   # In client/.env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-production-domain.com
   NODE_ENV=production

   # In server/.env
   NODE_ENV=production
   JWT_SECRET=<generate-secure-32-char-minimum-string>
   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://<prod-user>:<prod-pass>@<prod-host>:5432/hexport_prod
   ```

2. **Database Preparation**

   ```bash
   # Run migrations on production database
   npx prisma migrate deploy

   # Verify database connection
   psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"
   ```

3. **Security Checks**

   - [ ] Rotate all secrets and API keys
   - [ ] Verify no hardcoded credentials in code
   - [ ] SSL/TLS certificates configured
   - [ ] Security headers configured
   - [ ] WAF/DDoS protection enabled (if using cloud)

4. **Verification Checklist**
   - [ ] All environment files updated
   - [ ] Database migrations applied
   - [ ] Docker images built and tested
   - [ ] Rollback plan verified
   - [ ] Support team briefed
   - [ ] Monitoring configured
   - [ ] Alerting configured
   - [ ] Backup procedures verified

## 🎯 Deployment Verification Steps

### Immediate Post-Deployment (First 30 minutes)

```bash
# 1. Check Server Health
curl https://your-api-domain.com/health

# 2. Check Frontend
curl https://your-frontend-domain.com

# 3. Verify Database
# Connect and run: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;

# 4. Check Logs
# Monitor for any errors or warnings
```

### First Day Monitoring

- Monitor error rate (should be < 0.1%)
- Monitor response times
- Monitor CPU and memory usage
- Check for any failed transactions
- Verify blockchain operations working
- Test critical user flows manually
