# ‚úÖ PRE-SUBMISSION CHECKLIST - WHAT TO DO NOW

## üìã Complete Verification Status

Your project has been **fully verified** and is **ready for submission**. Here's what you need to do:

---

## üöÄ IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (Before Submission)

### 1. ‚úÖ Review Key Documentation

Read these in order:

- [ ] `START_HERE.md` - Begin here for overview
- [ ] `JUDGE_CREDENTIALS.md` - Understand judge testing
- [ ] `README_SUBMISSION.md` - Main submission document
- [ ] `SUBMISSION_CHECKLIST.md` - Verify all 60 requirements

### 2. ‚úÖ Verify Git Status

```powershell
# Check that repository is clean
cd c:\Users\makni\OneDrive\Bureau\Altavo\RWA
git status
```

Expected output:

```
On branch main
nothing to commit, working tree clean
(or only documentation files listed as untracked)
```

### 3. ‚úÖ Test Server Start (Optional)

```powershell
# Server
cd server
npm install
npm run dev

# In new terminal - Client
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

## üéØ SUBMISSION WORKFLOW

### Step 1: Finalize Repository

```powershell
cd c:\Users\makni\OneDrive\Bureau\Altavo\RWA

# Add all documentation files
git add .

# Commit with meaningful message
git commit -m "Add comprehensive submission documentation (60 requirements met)"

# Verify
git status
```

### Step 2: Verify Credentials File

Before submitting, ensure you have:

```powershell
# In root directory, you should have prepared:
# - A .env file with real credentials (keep locally only!)
# - Ready to provide to judges when asked
# - NEVER commit this file
```

### Step 3: Double-Check

- [ ] All code TypeScript checks pass: `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit` ‚úÖ
- [ ] No secrets in .gitignore'd files ‚úÖ
- [ ] README.md points to documentation ‚úÖ
- [ ] All 18 documentation files present ‚úÖ

### Step 4: Submit to DoraHacks

1. Go to [DoraHacks](https://dorahacks.io)
2. Submit your project
3. Provide GitHub repository link (make sure it's public!)
4. Upload your project to DoraHacks
5. When asked for credentials, reference `JUDGE_CREDENTIALS.md`

## üîë CREDENTIALS MANAGEMENT

### For Judges

When judges need to test:

1. Have `JUDGE_CREDENTIALS.md` ready
2. This file explains:
   - How to access the 10-minute test
   - What test accounts are available
   - What they'll see
   - How to verify NFTs on Hedera

### Your Environment

Your local `.env` file has:

```
HEDERA_ACCOUNT_ID=0.0.6370373 (ED25519)
HEDERA_PRIVATE_KEY=[your-key]
HEDERA_SUPPLY_KEY=[your-key]
DATABASE_URL=[connection-string]
JWT_SECRET=[your-secret]
...etc
```

**NEVER commit this file** - it's in `.gitignore` ‚úÖ

---

## üß™ FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Before you submit, verify:

- [ ] Repository is **public** on GitHub
- [ ] All files are committed (except .env)
- [ ] TypeScript compiles: `cd server && npx tsc --noEmit`
- [ ] No console.log statements left in production code
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets in any files
- [ ] `.env` is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] `README.md` links to START_HERE.md
